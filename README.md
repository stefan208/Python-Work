This script performs an end-to-end process for analyzing financial and operational KPI data:

    Data loading and merging: Imports multiple Excel files containing financial and operational KPIs, merging them by the common date field to build a unified dataset.

    Data cleaning and preparation: Standardizes column names, removes duplicates, sorts data chronologically, and fills missing values to ensure high data quality and consistency—critical for reliable analysis.

    Trend analysis on revenue KPI: Calculates Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rates, and applies linear regression to identify long-term trends.

    Time series decomposition: Breaks down the revenue data into trend, seasonal, and residual components to uncover underlying patterns and irregularities.

    Visualization: Presents comprehensive charts that depict revenue behavior and its components over time, supporting strategic decision-making.

This pipeline demonstrates practical skills in data integration, quality control, and financial time series analysis—key capabilities for roles focused on risk management and data-driven financial insights.
